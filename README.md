# Sessile-Drop-Analyzer
In this project, I developed a parameter optimization software for the numerical solution of a system of non-linear differential equations. The software obtained the best Laplacian curve fit to experimental drop interface providing accurate values for interfacial tension and contact angle parameters. To improve the software accuracy, I used a variety of image processing algorithms including low pass frequency filters for image de-noising, histogram analysis for image enhancement and binarization, and a subpixel edge detection method for obtaining a smoother drop interface. This software is currently in use by the industry.
